1
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:57,723
I still ask myself if I did the right
thing, when I abandoned this floating city.

2
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:01,570
And I don't mean only for the work.

3
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:07,633
The fact is,
a friend like that,

4
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,235
a real friend,

5
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:12,654
you won't meet one again

6
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:16,241
if you just decide to
hang up your sea legs,

7
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:20,996
if you just want to feel
something more solid beneath your feet

8
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,999
and then you no longer hear
the music of the Gods around you.

9
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:35,991
But, like he used to say:

10
00:01:37,984 --> 00:01:42,857
"You're never really done for
as long as you've got a good story"

11
00:01:43,983 --> 00:01:45,910
"and someone to tell it to."

12
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:55,944
The trouble is, nobody would
believe a single word of my story.

13
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:48,480
It happened every time that
someone would look up and see her.

14
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,759
It's difficult to understand.

15
00:02:54,385 --> 00:03:00,793
What I am saying is, there'd be more
than a thousand of us on that ship,

16
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,149
traveling rich folk,
immigrants,

17
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:06,920
and strange people and us.

18
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:13,075
Yet, there was always one,
one guy alone,

19
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:15,320
who could see her first.

20
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:19,266
Maybe he was just
sitting there eating

21
00:03:19,552 --> 00:03:21,632
or walking on the deck.

22
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,001
Maybe he was just
fixing his pants.

23
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:28,669
And for a couple of seconds,
a quick glance out to sea

24
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:32,038
and he'd see her.

25
00:03:32,464 --> 00:03:37,626
Then he'd just stand there,
rooted to the spot, his heart racing.

26
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:42,531
And every time,
every damned time, I swear,

27
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:49,999
he'd turn to us, towards the ship,
towards everybody and scream...

28
00:03:50,805 --> 00:03:52,456
America!

29
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:15,408
And I lost big money betting on
who'd be the first guy to see her,

30
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,382
America.

31
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:25,472
<i>- TНE LEGEND OF 1900 -</i>

32
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:57,673
It's a miracle! Santa Rosalia!

33
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,985
What do you mean Santa Rosalia?
It's the Madonna of Lourdes!

34
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,853
New York!

35
00:06:44,593 --> 00:06:49,790
The one who sees America first...
There's one on every ship.

36
00:06:50,892 --> 00:06:55,296
And don't be thinking it's an accident
or some optical illusion.

37
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,533
It's destiny.

38
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:05,564
Those are people who always had that
precise instant stamped on their life.

39
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,006
And when they were kids,
you could look into their eyes

40
00:07:11,122 --> 00:07:15,875
and if you looked carefully enough,
you'd already see her,

41
00:07:17,702 --> 00:07:19,487
America.

42
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,079
And I've seen a few Americas!

43
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:39,434
Six years on that ship,
five crossings a year:

44
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,994
Europe, America and back.
Always soaking in the ocean!

45
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:50,586
When you stepped on land, you couldn't
even piss straight in the john.

46
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:53,514
It was steady,
the john I mean,

47
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,467
but you'd keep bobbing
like an idiot.

48
00:07:58,393 --> 00:08:02,689
Oh, you can get off a ship all right,
but off the ocean...

49
00:08:02,957 --> 00:08:05,999
I was just closing.
What can I do for you?

50
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,407
When I boarded
I was 24 years old,

51
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:18,748
and I only cared about one thing
in life: playing the trumpet.

52
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,987
I'm selling it.

53
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,469
A Conn.

54
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,005
Not bad.

55
00:08:39,994 --> 00:08:41,996
Best brass money can buy!
